What is your greatest weaknases? 

One of my greatest weaknease in which I am working on right is that I spend to much in details, and don't 

my advisor and mentor recomend me 

make it work, then make it pretty .

also I spend my time double or triple checking what I did


questions for the interviewer?
==============================

Is there anything you would've liked to know before starting to work at FB?

can you tell me a little bit about the demographics of the company?

did you do an internship? if so, was it harder to maintain your position as an intern or as a first year software developer?


 
 research about the products isssues, scandals, etc.
 
 
 passion questions
 have you had the chance to work directly with Yan Lecunn ? 
is he involved in all the projects?


PROJECT

BRAIN OCT CANCER
VERY INTERDISCIPLINARY 
	- Clinical Part = Physicians
	- Instrumentation = Physics, Optical Engineer, Electrical Engineers
	

	
Pitch of my person:

My name is Ronald, I am currently working as a data scientist and as a phd student in the department of biomedical engineering,
more specifically I work with machine learning applied to medical imaging diagnosis. My project is about brain cancer diagnosis using 
machine learning techniques. 

I did my undergrad in my home country Peru in Computer Science, and before coming to Unite states I work mainly and mostly at the
same time as Software Engineer and Computer Scientist for around 5 years 

I sort my spare time between video games, my guitar or dancing
